# Face Emotion Recognition using Deep Learning

## Project Overview
This project aims to develop a deep learning model that can recognize emotions from facial expressions in images. Using a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN), the task is to classify facial expressions into different emotional categories such as "Happy," "Sad," "Angry," "Surprised," and others. The goal is to build an emotion recognition system that can accurately predict emotions from facial images.

## Project Requirements
### Python Libraries:
- `tensorflow` or `keras` for building the deep learning model.
- `opencv` or `PIL` for image preprocessing.
- `matplotlib` for visualizations.
- `numpy` and `pandas` for data manipulation.

## Model Architecture
The model uses Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN) for feature extraction from images. The architecture is designed as follows:
- Convolutional layers for extracting features from images.
- Max-pooling layers to reduce dimensionality.
- Dropout layers for regularization.
- A fully connected layer before the output layer.
- Softmax activation function in the output layer for multi-class classification.

## Project Steps

### 1. Data Understanding and Preprocessing
**Objective**: Understand the dataset structure and prepare it for training.

**Tasks**:
- Load and explore the dataset structure (number of classes, image resolution, labels).
- Resize images to a uniform size.
- Normalize pixel values to scale the images to a range of [0, 1].
- Split the dataset into training, validation, and test sets.
- Perform data augmentation (rotation, zoom, flip) to improve model robustness.

### 2. Model Construction
**Objective**: Build and compile a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) for emotion recognition.

**Tasks**:
- Design a CNN model to process images and predict emotional categories.
- Use convolutional layers, max-pooling, and dropout for regularization.
- Add a fully connected layer before the output layer.
- Use a softmax activation function for the output layer.
- Compile the model using the `categorical_crossentropy` loss function and accuracy metric.

### 3. Model Training and Evaluation
**Objective**: Train the model on the training data and evaluate its performance.

**Tasks**:
- Train the model on the training dataset and validate it using the validation dataset.
- Use EarlyStopping to prevent overfitting.
- Evaluate the model on the test data and report accuracy and loss.
- Plot training and validation loss/accuracy curves to monitor training progress.

### 4. Model Optimization
**Objective**: Improve model performance.

**Tasks**:
- Experiment with different CNN architectures (e.g., adding more layers, changing kernel sizes).
- Tune hyperparameters like the learning rate, batch size, and number of epochs.
- Implement techniques like data augmentation, dropout, or batch normalization to improve generalization.

### 5. Face Emotion Prediction
**Objective**: Make predictions on new images.

**Tasks**:
- Load the trained model and use it to predict the emotion on unseen images.
- Preprocess input images (resize, normalize).
- Predict the emotion category using the trained CNN model.
- Visualize the predicted emotion along with the image.

### 6. Model Evaluation
**Objective**: Evaluate the performance of the model using additional metrics.

**Tasks**:
- Generate a confusion matrix to show how well the model predicts each emotion.
- Calculate precision, recall, and F1-score for each class.
- Report the model's overall accuracy and provide insights on misclassified emotions.

## Expected Outcomes
### Data Preprocessing:
Students will learn how to handle image datasets, resize, normalize, and augment data for deep learning models.

### Deep Learning Model Development:
Students will build a CNN from scratch and train it to classify facial emotions accurately.

### Model Evaluation:
Students will evaluate the model's performance using accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score, and analyze misclassified emotions.

### Prediction:
Students will understand how to deploy a trained model for real-time emotion prediction on new facial images.

## Conclusion
This project helps in building a robust emotion recognition system using deep learning techniques. The model can predict emotions from facial expressions, making it applicable in various real-world applications such as human-computer interaction, sentiment analysis, and security systems.
